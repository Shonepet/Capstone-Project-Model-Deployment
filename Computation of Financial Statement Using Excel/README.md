Tasks and Step-by-Step Guide: 
Income Statement Preparation: 
•	Task: Assemble an Income Statement using the provided transactions. 
•	Instructions: Calculate Net Income or Loss by deducting total expenses from total revenues. 
•	Excel Tip: Use Excel formulas to automatically calculate totals and subtotals to ensure accuracy and efficiency. 
Statement of Owner’s Equity: 
•	Task: Create the Statement of Owner’s Equity. 
•	Instructions: Start with the beginning owner’s equity (assume zero unless stated otherwise), add net income from the Income Statement, include any owner's investments and withdrawals, and compute the ending owner's equity. 
•	Excel Tip: Link your calculations directly to the Income Statement’s net income to reflect updates dynamically. 
Balance Sheet Construction: 
•	Task: Construct a Balance Sheet that lists assets, liabilities, and equity. 
•	Instructions: Ensure the Balance Sheet balances (Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Owner’s Equity).

Statement of Cash Flows: 
•	Task: Prepare the Statement of Cash Flows using the indirect method. 
•	Instructions: Adjust Net Income for non-cash transactions and changes in working capital. List cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.

Setup Accounts: Create ledger accounts using Excel sheets for Cash, Accounts Receivable, Service Revenue, etc. Use formulas to update balances automatically.
Financial Statements:
Income Statement: Sum up all revenue and expense accounts to determine the Net Income or Loss.
Statement of Owner’s Equity: Start with the initial investment, add net income, and adjust for dividends or additional investments/withdrawals to calculate the ending owner’s equity.
Balance Sheet: Organize assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity to ensure the equation balances.
Statement of Cash Flows: Utilize the indirect method by starting with net income, adjusting for non-cash transactions like depreciation, and reflecting changes in working capital from balance sheet accounts.

By following these steps, students will not only learn how to manage and analyze financial data but also gain proficiency in using Excel for financial reporting. This exercise can be enhanced by including hypothetical scenarios where students must adjust entries for errors or assess the impact of different financial decisions.
